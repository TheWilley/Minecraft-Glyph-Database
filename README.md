# Minecraft Glyph Database

Minecraft Glyph Database (MGD) is a comprehensive, searchable list of all default glyphs in Java-Minecraft's font textures.

This project is devided into two folders:

- `generator` (JSON compiler).
- `webpage` (GUI / Frontend)

To succesfully compile the webpage, go trough the steps in the [generator](#generator) section before the [webpage](#webpage) section.

### Generator

This part of the project is responsible for generating a file in JSON format that contains:

- Glyph textures encoded in base64
- Glyph character representation
- Unicode character representation
- Glyph widths
- On which bitmap the given Glyph is found
- The position of the glyph within the bitmap

#### About Minecraft Fonts

![](readme/Fonts%20Overview.png)  
_An Overview of Minecrafts font hierarchy_

The Java version of Minecraft uses a typeface called **Minecraft Seven** which includes 4 different fonts: `default`, `alt`, `uniform` and `illageralt` [^1].

- `alt` is visible in enchanting tables
- `uniform` font is only employed when the Force Unicode Font option in Language is ON
- `illageralt` goes unused, although can technically still be accessed trough a JSON text key.
- `default`, as suggested by its name, is used in almost all situations.

The `default` font references 4 files: `ascii.png`, `accented.png`, `nonlatin_european.png` and `unifont.zip`. All except `unifont.zip` are images files containing Minecraft glyphs. The zip file meanwhile is a copy of GNU Unifont (15.0.06) [^2], a bitmap-based used in many operating systems. It acts as a fallback for glyphs that no other provider has defined a texture for (i.e certain langauges without supported glyphs).

Each font is constructed from a list ofÂ "providers", sources that provide characters to use. These providers are defined within JSON files with the same name as the after mentioned fonts. The `chars` key found within the `providers` array within a JSON contains sequences of Unicode characters. Each entry in the array represents a row, with each Unicode character representing a column. This creates a [bitmap](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bitmap) where each item is mapped to the corresponding spot in the reference file. For example, the character "i" in `ascii.png` is located at the 7th row and 10th column, which corresponds to the Unicode representation `u0069` in the bitmap. Some parts of the texture is blank, and this is because `u0000` represents a empty or NULL value, i.e, a sort of padding.

For this project, the `chars` key values are hardcoded in `textures.json`, along with bitmap names, rows, columns and texture size.

#### JSON Generation

> Navigate to the `generator` folder, then install all required packages using `npm i`

Javascript is used to parse minecraft bitmap textures. Using the providers in combination with them makes it possible to extract useful info. The exact implementation can be seen in `script.js`.

Because Minecraft assets fall under copyright you'll have to provide them yourself. The files you'll need are:

- accented.png
- ascii_sga.png
- ascii.png
- asciilager.png
- nolatin_european.png

These are automatically extracted from Minecrafts source code when running `script.js`. Simply provide the path to Minecraft's game folder (`.minecraft`) as such:

```
node .\script.js --path C:\Users\TheWilley\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft --name glyphs
```

This will result in a JSON file called `glyphs.json`. The name can be changed if desired.

##### Finding Textures Manually

If, for some reason, the script fails to find the textures, you can add them manually. The textures can be found within the `.jar` file of a Minecraft version. To find the `.jar`, navigate to Minecraft's game folder, then enter the `versions` folder. Within this folder, you should find more folders with versions in the format `x.x.x`, where `x` is a number.

In this case, `1.20.6` is the latest release. In this folder, you will find the `.jar` file with the same name as the folder. Open it using an archive manager, and follow this path: `assets > minecraft > textures > font`. In this folder, you'll find the aforementioned image files.

Move them to a folder called "textures" in the root directory of this part of the project (`generator`).

Lastly, add the `--skip` argument when running the script to skip automatic texture extraction.

```
node .\script.js --path C:\Users\TheWilley\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft --name glyphs --skip
```

After generating the JSON file, follow the README instructions in the `webpage` folder.

### Webpage

This part of the project is responsible for generating the webpage / GUI used to interact with the glyphs.

#### Webpage Generation

> Navigate to the `webpage` folder, then install all required packages using `npm i`

First off, follow the [JSON generation](#json-generation) instructions to generate the required JSON file. Then follow these steps:

1. Move the generated JSON inside the public folder within the `webpage` folder.
2. Within the `.env` file of the aftermentioned folder, change the `VITE_FILE` variable to the name of your JSON file (default is `glyphs.json`).
3. Run `npm run build` to build the webpage.
4. Run `npm run serve` to start the webpage on a server or upload to your own static host.
5. (optional) `npm run dev` can be used to start the dev server.

## Disclaimer

Although the compiled webpage for this project includes copyrighted textures, I personally see no reason for Mojang / Microsoft to take it down because:

1. This project was made for educational purposes.
2. I make no money from this project.
3. This project will have no negative effect on Minecraft's trademark in any way, shape, or form.

Of course, I will take the webpage down if asked, respecting copyright as such, but I created this not with malicious intent, but to satisfy curiosity and to educate.
